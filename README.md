# Fall-Detector-using-Python-and-OpenCV
I created this fall detector to passively monitor people of an advanced age as a capstone project for my research program in the summer of 2018. It uses active contour's to detect any falls, and then divulges an alarm message. The code can be fed to a Raspberry Pi 3. Check out my research paper - http://www.ijeijournal.com/vol7-iss9.html
Feel free to make any tweaks to improve the detector's accuracy at detecting falls!
