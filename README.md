# Fall-Detector-using-Python-and-OpenCV
I created this fall detector to passively monitor people of an advanced age in the summer of 2018 as a capstone project for my research program. It uses active contour's to detect any falls, and then divulges an alarm message. The code can be fed to a Raspberry Pi 3.
